# Known issues and future work

## What is missing

1. *Long-term events*: If an event lasts more than a day, it will only be added to the calendar on the starting day.
2. *Advanced marker options*: Markers do not offer much information about the events happening that day. They could incorporate more information and also there should be the possibility to customise them.
3. *Searching bars*: Currently there are no search bars for finding a certain date or for finding a certain event.
4. *Calendar view options*: The calendar could benefit from additional calendar views (e.g., week) to provide users with more flexibility in how they view events.

## Issues

1. *UI design consistency*: The user interface is basic and lacks a consistent design language. Some screens may not align well with modern UI/UX principles, potentially leading to a suboptimal user experience.
2. *Performance issues on older devices*: The app may experience performance issues or slow response times on older Android devices. Optimization for various device specifications could improve usability.
3. *Firebase error handling*: The error handling for Firebase interactions is minimal. Better error messages and user feedback would help users understand what went wrong during operations like log in or event creation.
4. *Better time selectors*: The selectors for the starting date and time of an event could have a better interface, as well as the selector for the duration.

## Potential future developments to improve/expand the software

1. *Notifications*: The app currently lacks the functionality for sending notifications and reminders for upcoming events.
2. *User profile management*: Adding options for editing the profile, changing the password, and managing preferences would improve the user experience.
3. *Creating multiple calendars*: Currently all the events of a user are added to the same calendar. The option of adding multiple calendars (e.g., work, free time, vacation) would improve the user experience.
4. *Localization and internationalization*: Expanding language support for users in different regions could broaden the app's audience and make it more accessible.
