## Abstract
Temporario is a mobile application that functions as a calendar, for personal time management. Once registered, the user can see the up-to-date calendar, scroll through it, add new events, see the details of existing events and edit them, or even delete cancelled or unwanted events from the calendar. Temporario, with its user-friendly interface, aims to ease the process of planning and managing personal or professional activities. It is also useful as a reminder of the schedule for the day ðŸ“…. The inputs regarding the events are taken from a form cointaining fields for description, date, time, and duration, all of which can be edited. 

By being a simple app, Temporario allows users of any kind to easily use it, from children who would like to see their school schedule on the app, to busy employees who are trying to schedule their meetings and their free time, and to old people who would like to remember when the loved ones are visiting. With just a few clicks, Temporario can make managing your life a pleasure.

Due to the sign-in feature, users with more than one Android device can log in to the app from all of them, as the calendar's details will always be kept synchronized, whether uploaded from a mobile phone or edited from a tablet. All the information is stored in a remote database, rather than locally on the user's phone. Moreover, creating an account is easy by using the Google Sign-In API. As such, anyone with a Google account can rapidly create a Temporario account. Of course, the default method of making a Temporario account is also present for users who prefer it.
